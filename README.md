## Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges in the telecom industry. This project builds a predictive pipeline that:

1. **Explores** the data through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
2. **Engineers** meaningful features (service count, tenure buckets)
3. **Trains & tunes** 6 different classification models with cross-validation
4. **Interprets** predictions using SHAP feature importance
5. **Saves** trained models for future deployment

## Dataset

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Source** | [IBM Sample – Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) |
| **Rows** | 7,043 customers |
| **Columns** | 21 features |
| **Target** | `Churn` (Yes / No) |
| **Class Balance** | ~26.5% churned, ~73.5% retained |

### Features at a Glance

| Category | Features |
|---|---|
| **Demographics** | Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents |
| **Account** | Tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod |
| **Services** | PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies |
| **Charges** | MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges |

---

## Key Insights

### 🔍 Customer Profile Most Likely to Churn

- **New customers** with less than 12 months tenure
- Subscribed to **Fiber optic** internet service
- On a **Month-to-Month** contract
- Paying via **Electronic Check** (churn rate ≈ 45.3% — ~3× other methods)
- **No add-on services** (no online security, tech support, or device protection)
- **No partner** and **no dependents**

### 🔑 Most Important Features

| Rank | Feature | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tenure** | Single strongest predictor — shorter tenure = higher risk |
| 2 | **Contract type** | Two-year contracts are the strongest protective factor |
| 3 | **Monthly charges** | Higher charges increase churn, especially for new customers |
| 4 | **Internet service** | Fiber optic customers churn at nearly 2× the rate of DSL |
| 5 | **Payment method** | Electronic check users churn at ~3× the rate of other methods |

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Preporcessing 
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (`src/EDA.py`)
- **Univariate**: Bar plots for categorical features, histogram + KDE for numerical
- **Bivariate**: Crosstab bar plots, box plots, violin plots (MonthlyCharges × Contract × Churn)
- **Multivariate**: Correlation matrix, pair plot

### 3. Feature Engineering (`src/features_engineering.py`)
### 4. Data Splitting
- Stratified split to preserve class balance

### 5. Modeling (`src/modeling.py`)
- 5-Fold Cross-Validation for generalization assessment
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV
- Models trained: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, GBM

### 6. Interpretability
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature importance for the best model

### 7. Model Persistence (`src/utils.py`)
- All trained models saved as `.pkl` files via `joblib`
- Results DataFrame saved alongside models

## Model Performance

| Model | CV Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| **XGBoost** | **0.806** | **0.810** |
| Logistic Regression | 0.803 | 0.810 |
| GBM | 0.804 | 0.803 |
| Random Forest | 0.799 | 0.801 |
| CatBoost | 0.792 | 0.798 |
| KNN Classifier | 0.780 | 0.777 |

> **Best Model: XGBoost** — achieved the highest AUC of **0.81** with strong generalization (minimal gap between CV and validation accuracy).

---

## Feature Importance

Based on SHAP analysis of the XGBoost model:

- **Tenure** is the most important feature for predicting churn
- **Two-year contracts** significantly reduce churn prediction
- Having **no internet service** or **low monthly charges** also reduce churn risk
- **Fiber optic** internet and **electronic check** payment push predictions toward churn

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-customer-churn.git
cd telco-customer-churn

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Pipeline

```bash
# Full pipeline (EDA + Training + Save)
python main.py

# Skip EDA plots (faster)
python main.py --skip_eda

# Custom directories
python main.py --data_dir data/ --models_dir models/ --output_dir outputs/
```

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--data_dir` | `data/` | Directory containing the CSV file |
| `--models_dir` | `models/` | Directory to save trained models |
| `--output_dir` | `outputs/` | Directory to save plots and results |
| `--skip_eda` | `False` | Skip EDA visualizations |

## Results

The pipeline generates the following outputs:

### EDA Visualizations (in `outputs/`)
- Categorical feature distributions with churn breakdown
- Numerical feature distributions (histogram + KDE)
- Box plots and violin plots comparing churned vs. retained
- Correlation matrix and pair plots

### Model Comparison Charts (in `outputs/`)
- Validation accuracy bar chart across all models
- CV accuracy vs. validation accuracy line chart

### Saved Models (in `models/`)
- 6 trained model files (`.pkl`)
- Results summary DataFrame

## Conclusion

**Churn is not random.** It follows clear, detectable patterns. With the right model, a telecom company can meaningfully reduce churn and protect its revenue. This pipeline demonstrates that even with a relatively simple feature set, models like XGBoost can identify at-risk customers with over 80% accuracy — enabling proactive retention strategies.
